            I would wholeheartedly recommend Gillian as a music teacher for kids and adults alike.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about'>Gillian has been teaching me the ABRSM syllabus for 5 years. She is a fantastic teacher, who strikes the perfect balance between providing a solid grounding in music theory, technique and practice disciplines; whilst also creating an encouraging and motivating environment during lessons, with musicality firmly at the core of each lesson.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about'>As an adult learner, I can vary the pace of my learning depending on other commitments and Gillian has always been flexible and accommodating, but also knows when to push the pace of our study forward.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about'>My son started learning with Gillian last year as a three year old and he absolutely loves piano lessons. He has made excellent progress and most importantly, he enjoys sitting at the piano at home and making music. Gillian is extremely patient with children and her warm teaching style and friendly manner inspire confidence. She encourages young kids to give things a go and I have noticed my son’s confidence grow as he has made progress, which has helped him in other areas including with his schoolwork.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about p-bottom-padding'>Gillian is very friendly and good fun to be around. I always look forward to my lessons every week!

            I am an older student who wanted to take piano lessons, I was very nervous as I had no previous musical experience and didn’t know where to begin....... then I found Gillian!
            </p>
            <p className='p-about'>Gillian is so welcoming, she has a great attitude and she has been exceptionally patient in teaching me the piano for the past 3 years.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about'>The thing that I like the most about Gillian is she doesn’t make you feel bad about your mistakes, she is there to support you.
            </p>
            <p className='p-about p-bottom-padding'>I look forward to continuing my musical journey with Gillian and would highly recommend her to anyone wishing to learn the piano.
