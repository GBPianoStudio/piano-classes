          <p className="p-about">My name is Gillian Beckwith and I teach piano in East Belfast. 
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">I grew up playing piano and cello and developed my skills through an HND in Applied Music and then moved onto a degree in Popular and Contemporary Music at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">Through my music courses I found I had a love of sound and how different sounds can be put together to form soundscapes which in turn can trigger different emotions. I went on to complete a Masters in Sound Design at Bounemouth University before moving to London to work in the media industry.  
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">After a year of travel and soul searching I decided to move back to Belfast and start a tutoring business. 
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">I teach a range of ages from 3-53! I have more than 20 years of teaching experience. I donâ€™t mind what each client wants to do, it can be playing for fun or working towards grades.  
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">I am currently doing a Teaching Microcredential course called Embedding Mental Health in the Curriculum (finishing in May 2023) to learn how to better help my students' mental health improve, especially post-COVID pandemic.
          </p>
          <p className="p-about">For Practical and Theory Grades I use the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. I am a member of the European Piano Teacher Association (EPTA). 
          </p>
          <p className="p-about p-bottom-padding">Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
