          Hello!<br></br> <br></br>
          My name is Gillian Beckwith and I teach piano in East Belfast.<br></br>
          
I grew up playing piano and cello and developed my skills through an HND in Applied Music and then moved onto a degree in Popular and Contemporary Music at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.<br></br>
<br></br>Through my music courses I found I had a love of sound and how different sounds can be put together to form soundscapes which in turn can trigger different emotions. I went on to complete a Masters in Sound Design at Bounemouth University before moving to London to work in the media industry. 
<br></br>After a year of travel and soul searching I decided to move back to Belfast and start a tutoring business. 
<br></br><br></br>I teach a range of ages from 3-53! I donâ€™t mind what each client wants to do, it can be playing for fun or working towards grades. 
<br></br><br></br>For Practical and Theory Grades I use the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. I am a member of the European Piano Teacher Association (EPTA).
<br></br><br></br>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
