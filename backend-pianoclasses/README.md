## Description  

<p>
GILLIAN BECKWITH Piano Studio is a project adapted to the needs of renowned piano teacher GILLIAN BECKWITH. Gillian manages the studio from her mobile device  or PC, allowing her to grant her students access to the calendar to book their lessons. Within 24 hours, she commits to confirming or rejecting the request,  and the student is notified by email. Gillian also has full control of the calendar, allowing her to decide which days and hours are available for her      students to book their classes.
The administrative part is designed for easy management of student data, where she can give them access to book their classes, edit user information, and delete it..
